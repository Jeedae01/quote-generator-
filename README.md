The quote generator is a simple and easy to access code.
The code is as a result of motivation that anyone can view to help people overcome depression.
To access the code, all you need is to clone or copy the file.
Save it in a folder on your desktop.
open the the four folders, majorly the Index.html, Script.js and Style.css files with any code editor of your choice(suggesting VS code).
Run the files and read series of quotes to help overcome worries.
The Quotes.js file is a work in progress and would be fully updated later.
